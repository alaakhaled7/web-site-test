      <h2><strong> Definition of programming  </strong> </h2>
      <p>
          Programming is the implementation of logic to facilitate specific computing operations and functions, and occurs in one or more languages, which vary by application, field, programming model, and writing method.
          
          Programming language semantics and syntax are used when creating an application, hence programming requires knowledge of application areas, algorithms, and programming language expertise.
          
          The logic of a programming language varies by developer, and good code can be evaluated by factors such as:
          <br>
          Durability: Focuses on the sustainability of the program, regardless of bugs or incorrect data. 
          <br>Reliability: Focuses on correct design and algorithm implementation.
          <br>
          Efficiency: Focuses on memory, hardware, or other characteristics used to improve software.
          <br>
          Readability: Provides appropriate documentation and indentation, which provides insight to other software developers or designers.

    <h2><strong> Importance of programming: </strong> </h2>
    <p>
        Programming is important for creating programs and applications thatassist computer and mobile users in daily life. <br>
        Programming languages, such as Java, Python, Ruby, and others are <br>the reasons behind innovations in information technology. <br>
        Programming languages ​​are the method for creating programs that <br>perform different or specific tasks in a systematic way. <br>
        Computer programming languages ​​allow us to provide instructions to <br>a computer in a language that the computer understands. <br>
        Without programmers writing computer programs, which tell computers and <br>other technological devices, what to do, none of us will be able to enjoy any<br> of the luxuries technology has to offer.

    <h2><strong> programming languages : </strong> </h2>
    <p>
        A programming language has a vocabulary and a set of grammar rules, to guide the computer, to perform specific tasks, each
         programming language contains a unique set of keywords, and a special syntax to organize the program instructions.
    </p>
    <h2><strong> Types of programming languages:  </strong> </h2>
<p>
    There are dozens of programming languages ​​used, in terms of high-level and low-level languages, and the following are the most important programming languages:<br>

    Java: A general purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language with many features that make it ideal for web-based development.<br>
    Ruby: An open source, object-oriented scripting language that can be used independently or as part of the Ruby on Rails framework.<br>
    
     
    HTML: The standard markup language used to create web pages, it ensures the correct formatting of text and images (using tags), used by web developers, technical editors, email designers and software engineers.<br>
    
     
    JavaScript: a client-side programming language that runs inside the client's browser, and processes commands on a computer instead of on a server.<br>
    C: a structure-oriented programming language, mostly used for developing low-level applications.<br>
    C ++: a general purpose programming language, object-oriented, mid-level, extension of C language.<br>
    Objective-C: A simple, general-purpose language, using a borrowed passer-by message system from SmallTalk, used by iOS and Android app developers.<br>
    PHP: An open source programming language designed, to create dynamic web pages that work effectively with databases.<br>
    SQL Language: a database query language, (not a development language) that allows adding, accessing, and managing content in a database.<br>
    Swift Language: Apple's latest open source multi-paradigm programming language for iOS and OS X applications, and includes an advanced translator, debugger, and framework infrastructure.<br>
    Python: a sophisticated programming language that is interpreted and directed towards an object, and built on flexible and strong semantics.<br>

            The most important fields of programming :
        </h2>
        <p>
            1- Web Development.<br>
            2- Mobile Development.<br>
            3- Game Development.<br>
            4- Operating System Development.<br>
            5- DeskTob Development.<br>
            6- Database management and programming.<br>
            7- Robotics Development.<br>
            As we previously talked about, each field of programming has its own languages ...,<br> and there are areas under which other branches fall, for example, <br>the website programming track is divided into ...
            <br>-FrontEnd
            -BackEnd
            <br>The track for mobile application programming is divided into ...
            <br>- Android
            - iOS
            <br> And each of these branches has its own languages,<br> and so on in the rest of the fields of programming.
